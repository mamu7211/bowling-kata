============

Build
-----

To build the project from command line, type "mvn package" or "mvn clean compile assembly:single".
Test can be run with "mvn test".

Run
---

Cd to "./target/" and run it, e.g. "java -jar game-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar". If you get some "NoClassDefFoundError" you're likely running the jar without dependencies.
